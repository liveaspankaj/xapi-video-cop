## ADL

## API

Application Programming Interface. A set of rules and standards created to allow access into a software application or tool.

## IRI

Internationalized Resource Identifier. A unique identifier which could be an IRL. Used to identify an object such as a verb, activity or activity type. Unlike URIs, IRIs can contain some characters outside of the ASCII character set in order to support international languages.

IRIs always include a scheme. This is not a requirement of this standard, but part of the definition of IRIs, per RFC 3987. What are sometimes called "relative IRIs" are not IRIs.

## IRL

Internationalized Resource Locator. In the context of this document, an IRL is an IRI that when translated into a URI (per the IRI to URI rules), is a URL.

## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation

## LMS

Learning Management System.  "A software package used to administer one or more courses to one or more learners. An LMS is typically a web-based system that allows learners to authenticate themselves, register for courses, complete courses and take assessments" (Learning Systems Architecture Lab definition). An LMS in this document is used as an example of how a user is identified as "trusted" within a system and able to access its Learning Experiences.

## LRP

Learning Record Provider. An xAPI Client that sends data to Learning Record Store\(s\). Often, the Learning Record Provider will create Learning Records while monitoring a learner as a part of a Learning Experience.

## LRS

Learning Record Store. A server \(i.e. system capable of receiving and processing web requests\) that is responsible for receiving, storing, and providing access to Learning Records.
